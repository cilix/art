### art
A highly compressed radix tree heavily based on the Adaptive Radix Tree ([paper](http://www3.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~leis/papers/ART.pdf))

##### features
* very portable - clean C89 implementation
* designed as a primary indexing data structure - the paper above describes a secondary index that doesn't fully own its keys
* non recursive update algorithms 

##### todo
* prefix lookup
* add comments :(
